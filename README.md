- 👋 Hi, I’m @andlil9999
- 👀 I’m interested in sound and computer music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ using Microsoft Vsisual Studio and using the FFTW library to do 
- Fourier transform of sound files. The (vague) idea I have currently is to maybe use this 
- to classify samples using FFT, e.g. finding all kick drum samples automatically in a huge collection
- and sort the sounds according to some criterias, e.g. short kicks, dry kicks, thin kicks, sub kicks, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code using the FFTW library.
- 📫 How to reach me: anders.liljeborg@bredband.net
